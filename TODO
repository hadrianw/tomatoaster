* building
	* have a separate tool that would generate a makefile (or equivalent) to a specified builddir
	* actually use a proper tool for dependency generation, possibilities:
		* make
		* ninja
		* writing own simple tool? a shell script?
	* dependency tree:
		whole-disk.img
			efi.img
				grub.img
					memdisk.tar
			kernel
				kernel.tar
					rootfs
			rootfs
				void-packages
				the-rest
			rwfs

* AB partitions and Grub
	* give sensible options to the whole disk image generator - types, padding, separate flag for output file
	* update partitions in the whole disk image
	* watchdog daemon and watchdog.open_timeout=30 ?
* updates
	* marking oneshooted rootfs as default after booting
	* sqfsdiff, it can do extract of new files, add an option to suppress extracting old files
	* genimage should check for new files and pack them first in case of updates

* extract all compressed files, at least to level of stored
* sqlite for users/xattrs instead of user.escape

* user management and installation in general - updates of /etc and other directories, revert command to remove whiteouts
* for testing home directories should be packed as normal user - I have a hack for this, maybe it is enough
* if dracut persistance layer fails it must be noticable or panic
* file ordering in squashfs
* how to do ARM build on x86? - do only configure via qemu?
